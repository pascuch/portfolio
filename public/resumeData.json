    "bio": "Hi there! âœ‹ I'm Jose Chavarria (Pascu), Full Stack Developer with Frontend orientation. Having participated in individual and group projects, I was able to learn working methodologies in development teams. In these projects I used tools such as React, Redux, Node, Express, SQL, HTML, Sass, perfecting myself with Javascript. Passionate about technology and the solutions they provide to everyday life. I worked more than 10 years in accounting and supply areas, in this process I acquired new learning routes and ways to solve the problems that arise.",
